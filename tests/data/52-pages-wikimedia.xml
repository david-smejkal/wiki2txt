'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that is skeptical of all justifications for [[authority]] and seeks to abolish the [[institutions]] it claims maintain unnecessary [[coercion]] and [[Social hierarchy|hierarchy]], typically including [[Nation state|nation-states]],{{sfn|Suissa|2019b|ps=: &quot;...as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state.&quot;}} and [[capitalism]]. Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with [[Stateless society|stateless societies]] and [[Voluntary association|voluntary]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]]. As a historically [[left-wing]] movement, this reading of anarchism is placed on the [[Far-left politics|farthest left]] of the [[political spectrum]], usually described as the [[libertarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]] ([[libertarian socialism]]).

[[Humans]] have lived in [[society|societies]] without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of states, [[realm]]s, or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[scepticism]] toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. [[Anarchist schools of thought|Various anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more, growing in popularity and influence within [[anti-capitalist]], [[anti-war]] and [[anti-globalisation]] movements.

Anarchists employ [[diversity of tactics|diverse approaches]], which may be generally divided into revolutionary and [[evolutionary strategies]]; there is significant overlap between the two. Evolutionary methods try to simulate what an anarchist society might be like, but revolutionary tactics, which have historically taken a violent turn, aim to overthrow authority and the state. Many facets of human civilization have been influenced by anarchist theory, critique, and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].

== Etymology, terminology, and definition ==
{{main|Definition of anarchism and libertarianism}}
{{see also|Glossary of anarchism}}
[[File:WilhelmWeitling.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Weitling]] is an example of a writer who added to anarchist theory without using the exact term.{{sfn|Carlson|1972|pp=22–23}}]]
The etymological origin of ''anarchism'' is from the Ancient Greek ''anarkhia'', meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the prefix ''an-'' (&quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (&quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The suffix ''[[-ism]]'' denotes the ideological current that favours [[anarchy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} ''Anarchism'' appears in English from 1642 as ''anarchisme'' and ''anarchy'' from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder.{{sfnm|1a1=Merriam-Webster|1y=2019|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=''Oxford English Dictionary''|2y=2005|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|3a1=Sylvan|3y=2007|3p=260}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as ''anarchists'', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an ''anarchist'' ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} ''[[libertarianism]]'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guérin|1970|loc=&quot;The Basic Ideas of Anarchism&quot;}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} Some usages of ''libertarianism'' refer to [[individualistic]] [[free-market]] philosophy only, and [[free-market anarchism]] in particular is termed ''libertarian anarchism''.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}

While the term ''libertarian'' has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Cohn|2y=2009|2p=6}} its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups,{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} including both the [[New Left]] and [[libertarian Marxists]], who do not associate themselves with [[authoritarian socialists]] or a [[vanguard party]], and extreme [[cultural liberals]], who are primarily concerned with [[civil liberties]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} Additionally, some anarchists use ''[[libertarian socialist]]''{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Chomsky|2y=2005|2p=123|3a1=Cohn|3y=2009|3p=6|4a1=Levy|4a2=Adams|4y=2018|4p=104}} to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with [[socialism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} ''Anarchism'' is broadly used to describe the [[anti-authoritarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]].{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=104}}{{refn|In ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (1970),{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}} anarchist historian [[Daniel Guérin]] described it as a synonym for [[libertarian socialism]], and wrote that anarchism &quot;is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State.&quot;{{sfn|Arvidsson|2017}} In his many works on anarchism, such as ''Chomsky on Anarchism'' (2005),{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}} historian [[Noam Chomsky]] describes anarchism, alongside [[libertarian Marxism]], as the [[libertarian]] wing of [[socialism]].{{sfn|Otero|1994|p=617}}|group=nb}} Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state-oriented or from above.{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} Scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism's socialist credentials{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two.{{sfn|Morris|2015|p=64}} Some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from [[liberalism]],{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} and being both liberal and socialist but more so.{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} Many scholars reject [[anarcho-capitalism]] as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564–565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morris|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393–394}}{{refn|[[Herbert L. Osgood]] claimed that anarchism is &quot;the extreme antithesis&quot; of [[authoritarian communism]] and [[state socialism]].{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]] states that &quot;[i]n general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. ... Anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp, but it also has outriders in liberalism. It cannot be reduced to socialism, and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine.&quot;{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} According to [[Jeremy Jennings]], &quot;[i]t is hard not to conclude that these ideas&quot;, referring to [[anarcho-capitalism]], &quot;are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is.&quot; Jennings adds that &quot;anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual (as the 'anarcho-capitalists' appear to believe) but, as we have already seen, for the extension of individuality and community.&quot;{{sfn|Jennings|1999|p=147}} [[Nicolas Walter]] wrote that &quot;anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically. ... In a sense, anarchists always remain liberals and socialists, and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself. ... We are liberals but more so, and socialists but more so.&quot;{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} Michael Newman includes anarchism as one of many [[socialist traditions]], especially the more socialist-aligned tradition following Proudhon and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morris]] argues that it is &quot;conceptually and historically misleading&quot; to &quot;create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism.&quot;{{sfn|Morris|2015|p=64}}|group=nb}}

While [[Anti-statism|opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining ''anarchism'' is not an easy task for scholars, as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter, and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}}{{refn|One common definition adopted by anarchists is that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organisation]], including [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and all associated [[institution]]s, in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[decentralisation]], [[freedom]], and [[voluntary association]]. Scholars highlight that this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on anti-authoritarianism (''[[a posteriori]]'' conclusion), anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that),{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1p=166|2a1=Jun|2y=2009|2p=507|3a1=Franks|3y=2013|3pp=386–388}} and etymology (negation of rulers).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}}|group=nb}} Major definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society, and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}

== History ==
{{main|History of anarchism}}

=== Pre-modern era ===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] ({{Circa|334|262 BC}}), whose ''[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]
Before the creation of towns and cities, established authority did not exist. It was after the institution of authority that anarchistic ideas were espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} The most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] (the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophers [[Zhuang Zhou]] and [[Laozi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Alongside [[Stoicism]], Taoism has been said to have had &quot;significant anticipations&quot; of anarchism.{{Sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=257}}

Anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between laws imposed by the state and personal [[autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned [[Athens|Athenian]] authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''[[physis]]''). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}

In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements. These, and other Muslim movements, later gave birth to [[Anarchism and religion|religious anarchism]]. In the [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Mazdak]] called for an [[egalitarian]] society and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by Emperor [[Kavad I]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}}

In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state.{{Sfn|Crone|2000|pp=3, 21–25}} In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies.{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=8}} Renewed interest in antiquity during the [[Renaissance]] and in private judgment during the [[Reformation]] restored elements of anti-authoritarian secularism, particularly in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=108}} [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] challenges to intellectual authority (secular and religious) and the [[List of revolutions and rebellions|revolutions of the 1790s and 1848]] all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=307}}

=== Modern era ===
During the [[French Revolution]], partisan groups such as the [[Enragés]] and the {{lang|fr|[[sans-culottes]]}} saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as [[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in England, morally delegitimising the state, [[Max Stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} By the late 1870s, various anarchist schools of thought had become well-defined and a wave of then unprecedented [[globalisation]] occurred from 1880 to 1914.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=10–15}} This era of [[classical anarchism]] lasted until the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is considered the golden age of anarchism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Mikhail Bakunin opposed the Marxist aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.]]
Drawing from mutualism, [[Mikhail Bakunin]] founded [[collectivist anarchism]] and entered the [[International Workingmen's Association]], a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, with [[Karl Marx]] being a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction (the [[Jura Federation]]) and Proudhon's followers (the mutualists) opposed [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} After bitter disputes, the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the [[Marxists]] at the [[1872 Hague Congress]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} Anarchists were treated similarly in the [[Second International]], being ultimately expelled in 1896.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=12}} Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. In response to their expulsion from the First International, anarchists formed the [[St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one's needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}}

By the turn of the 20th century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} It was a notable feature of the international syndicalist movement.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=16}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for [[rebellion|rebellious]] youth from [[East Asia]]n countries, who moved to the Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In [[Latin America]], [[Anarchism in Argentina|Argentina]] was a stronghold for [[anarcho-syndicalism]], where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary [[political violence]], known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to prevent anarchists immigrating to the US, including the [[Immigration Act of 1903]], also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=633–636|2a1=Lutz|2a2=Ulmschneider|2y=2019|2p=46}} [[Illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|Nestor Makhno seen with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine]]]]
Despite concerns, anarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]] in opposition to the [[White movement]], especially in the [[Makhnovshchina]]; however, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] had stabilised, including during the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine, before the Bolsheviks crushed the anarchist movement there too.{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} With the anarchists being repressed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]], many workers and activists turned to [[communist parties]] which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements such as the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] left their organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}}

In the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–39, anarchists and syndicalists ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of [[Spanish anarchism]] led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war, and particularly in the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936]]. In response to the army [[rebellion]], an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain, where they [[collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The [[Soviet Union]] provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight between communists and other leftists in a series of events known as the [[May Days]], as Joseph Stalin asserted Soviet control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] government, ending in another defeat of anarchists at the hands of the communists.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}

==== Post-WWII ====
[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|Rojava's support efforts for workers to form cooperatives is exemplified in this sewing cooperative.]]
By the end of [[World War II]], the anarchist movement had been severely weakened.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} The 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism, likely caused by a perceived failure of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and tensions built by the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this time, anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]], and [[peace movement]]s, the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[New Left]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 539}} It also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative [[anti-capitalist reform]]ism.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=5|p=}} Anarchism became associated with [[punk subculture]] as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} The established [[feminist]] tendencies of [[anarcha-feminism]] returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556–557}} [[Black anarchism]] began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism's move from a [[Eurocentric]] demographic.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=680}} This coincided with its failure to gain traction in Northern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|p=70}}

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti-capitalist, anti-war and [[anti-globalisation]] movements.{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Group of Eight]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]. During the protests, ''ad hoc'' leaderless anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s engaged in [[riot]]ing, [[property destruction]] and violent confrontations with the [[police]]. Other organisational tactics pioneered at this time include [[affinity group]]s, [[security culture]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 Seattle WTO conference]].{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as [[Rojava]], a ''de facto'' [[Permanent autonomous zone|autonomous region]] in northern Syria.{{sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}}

While having revolutionary aspirations, many forms of anarchism are not confrontational nowadays. Instead, they are trying to build an alternative way of social organization, based on mutual interdependence and voluntary cooperation. Scholar Carissa Honeywell takes the example of [[Food not Bombs]] group of collectives, to highlight some features of how anarchist groups work: direct action, working together and in solidarity with those left behind. While doing so, they inform about the rising rates of world hunger suggest a policy to tackle hunger, ranging from de-funding the arms industry to addressing Monsanto seed-saving policies and patents, helping farmers and commodification of food and housing.{{sfn|Honeywell|2021|pp=34–44}} Honeywell also emphasizes that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not only of humans, but non-humans and the environment as well.{{sfn|Honeywell|2021|pp=1–2}} Honeywell argues that escalation of problems such as continuous wars and world poverty show that the current framework not only cannot solve those pressing problems for humanity, but are causal factors as well, resulting in the rejection of representative democracy and the state as a whole.{{sfn|Honeywell|2021|pp=1–3}}

== Thought ==
Anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, [[social anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], owing to their different origins, values and evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=Ostergaard|2y=2003|2p=14|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} The individualist current emphasises [[negative liberty]] in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises [[positive liberty]] in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and [[social ownership]].{{sfn|Harrison|Boyd|2003|p=251}} In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post-classical currents ([[anarcha-feminism]], [[green anarchism]], and [[post-anarchism]]) developed thereafter.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=9}}

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=2}} A component especially of individualist anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Ostergaard|1y=2003|1p=12|2a1=Gabardi|2y=1986|2pp=300–302}} philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a [[minimal state]] but claims that citizens have no [[moral obligation]] to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy.{{sfn|Klosko|2005|p=4}} Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since [[ethics]] have a central role in anarchist philosophy.{{sfn|Franks|2019|p=549}} Anarchism's emphasis on [[anti-capitalism]], [[egalitarianism]], and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho-capitalism and other types of [[economic libertarian]]ism.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564–565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morris|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393–394}}

Anarchism is usually placed on the far-left of the political spectrum.{{sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=Kahn|2y=2000|3a1=Moynihan|3y=2007}} Much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[anti-authoritarian]], [[anti-statist]], [[libertarian]], and [[Radical politics|radical]] interpretations of [[left-wing]] and [[socialist]] politics{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}} such as [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[anarchist communism|communism]], [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], among other [[libertarian socialist]] economic theories.{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=35|loc=&quot;Critique of authoritarian socialism&quot;}} As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}} One reaction against [[sectarianism]] within the anarchist milieu was [[anarchism without adjectives]], a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.{{sfn|Avrich|1996|p=6}} Belief in political [[nihilism]] has been espoused by anarchists.{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=52}} Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy, mutual aid, network organisation, communal democracy, justified authority and decentralisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=1–6|2a1=Angelbeck|2a2=Grier|2y=2012|2p=551}}

=== Classical ===
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is the primary proponent of mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=216–218}}]]
Inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]]. They were followed by the major currents of social anarchism ([[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]], [[anarchist communism|communist]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]]). They differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=2}}

Mutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Its aims include &quot;abolishing the state&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Desk Encyclopedia of World History |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7394-7809-7 |editor-last=Wright |editor-first=Edmund |location=New York |pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|free association]], voluntary contract, [[federation]] and [[monetary reform]] of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=213–218}} Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1996|1p=6|2a1=Miller|2y=1991|2p=11}} In ''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840), Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;{{sfn|Pierson|2013|p=187}} Collectivist anarchism is a [[revolutionary socialist]] form of anarchism{{sfn|Morris|1993|p=76}} commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Shannon|2019|p=101}} Collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution{{sfn|Avrich|1996|pp=3–4}} and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside Marxism but rejected the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist [[stateless society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heywood|1y=2017|1pp=146–147|2a1=Bakunin|2y=1990}}

Anarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a [[communist society]] with [[common ownership]] of the means of production,{{sfn|Mayne|1999|p=131}} held by a [[federalism|federal]] network of [[voluntary association]]s,{{Sfn|Marshall|1993|p=327}} with production and consumption based on the guiding principle &quot;[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=327|2a1=Turcato|2y=2019|2pp=237–238}} Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the [[French Revolution]]{{sfn|Graham|2005}} but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].{{sfn|Pernicone|2009|pp=111–113}} It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of [[Peter Kropotkin]],{{sfn|Turcato|2019|pp=239–244}} whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=6}} Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views [[labour syndicate]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are [[direct action]], workers' [[solidarity]] and [[workers' self-management]].{{sfn|Van der Walt|2019|p=249}}

Individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants.{{sfn|Ryley|2019|p=225}} Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include [[William Godwin]], [[Max Stirner]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=440}} as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as [[illegalism]] and [[individual reclamation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Imrie|1y=1994|2a1=Parry|2y=1987|2p=15}}

=== Post-classical and contemporary ===
{{main|Contemporary anarchism}}
[[File:Jarach and Zerzan.JPG|thumb|Lawrence Jarach (left) and [[John Zerzan]] (right) are two prominent contemporary anarchist authors, with Zerzan being a prominent voice within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and Jarach a notable advocate of [[post-left anarchy]].]]
Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti-globalisation movement,{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and [[syncretic|combining disparate concepts]] to create new philosophical approaches.{{sfn|Williams|2007|p=303}} The anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.{{sfn|Williams|2018|p=4}}

Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes [[black bloc]] demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence. Its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement, although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory.{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Evren|2y=2011|2p=1|3a1=Angelbeck|3a2=Grier|3y=2012|3p=549}} Various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385–386}} While theorists and activists have established &quot;relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles&quot;, there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple ''anarchisms'', rather than a singular ''anarchism'', in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. Gender equality can be a common principle, although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha-feminists than anarcho-communists.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}}

Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely &quot;all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism.&quot;{{sfn|Jun|2009|pp=507–508}} Anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.{{sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}} The principle of [[equal liberty]] is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions. This entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state, resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=91}}

== Tactics ==
Anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals, namely, to first oppose [[the Establishment]] and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=107–108}} A broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence, reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, although there is significant overlap between the two.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|p=125}}

Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=112}}

=== Classical era ===
[[File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg|thumb|left|The relationship between [[anarchism and violence]] is a controversial subject among anarchists as shown by anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]] [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinating]] [[William McKinley]].]]
During the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces, as in Spain and Ukraine, but some of them also employed terrorism as [[propaganda of the deed]]. Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in [[revolution]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=112–113}} Many anarchists, especially the [[Galleanists]], believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state.{{sfn|Norris|2020|pp=7–8}} Many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s, the early 1880s and the 1890s, with some still occurring in the early 1900s.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=13|2a1=Nesser|2y=2012|2p=62}} Their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|p=55}}

Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial.{{sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} Anarcho-pacifists advocate for non-violence means to achieve their stateless, nonviolent ends.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=section 3.1}} Other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of [[sabotage]] or terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a [[tyrant]] and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=116–117}} [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]].{{sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320–325}}

Anarchists took an active role in [[strike action]]s, although they tended to be antipathetic to formal [[syndicalism]], seeing it as [[reformist]]. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=113}} Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced [[naturism]] and [[nudism]]. Those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=114}}

=== Revolutionary ===
[[File:Black bloc at RNC running.jpg|thumb|Black bloc protesters parading anarcho-communism imagery such as the motto &quot;[[No War but the Class War]]&quot;]]
In the current era, Italian anarchist [[Alfredo Bonanno]], a proponent of [[insurrectionary anarchism]], has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group [[The Invisible Committee]] advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism, and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=134–135}}

Overall, contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries such as Canada, [[Anarchism in Greece|Greece]], and [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]]. Militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police;{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=115}} however, anarchists not only clash with state operators, they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking [[anti-fascist]] action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=117}}

=== Evolutionary ===
Anarchists commonly employ [[direct action]]. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Decision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[horizontalidad|horizontalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109–117}} Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various [[grassroots]] movements that are more or less based on horizontalism, although not explicitly anarchist, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. In contrast with the ''big-A anarchism'' of the classical era, the newly coined term ''small-a anarchism'' signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to justify their opinions. Those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=145–149}}

The decision-making process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics, goals and values. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]] as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=119–121}}

As in the past, newspapers and journals are used, and anarchists have gone online in the [[World Wide Web]] to spread their message. Anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties, hosting electronic libraries and other portals.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=118–119}} Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users' privacy from state surveillance.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=120–121}}

Anarchists organize themselves to [[Squatting|squat]] and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s (TAZ), spaces where art, poetry, and [[surrealism]] are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=Mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=Williams|3y=2018|3pp=5–6}} As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=Williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=122}} Adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[carnivalesque]] atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.{{sfn|Morland|2004|pp=37–38}}

{{main|Issues in anarchism}}
&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
As anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought; disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common. Its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed, and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism, [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], Marxism, and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], technology (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism), and the [[Anarchism and statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|De George|2005|pp=31–32}}

=== The state ===
&lt;!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. --&gt;[[File:Fight_the_state,_not_wars.jpg|thumb|Anarchist protesters in [[Boston]] opposing state-waged war]]
Objection to the [[State (polity)|state]] and its institutions is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=1971|1p=14|2a1=Jun|2y=2019|2pp=29–30}} Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]], as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}}

Specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. [[Robert Paul Wolff]] believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate. Bakunin saw the state as meaning &quot;coercion, domination by means of coercion, camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be.&quot; [[A. John Simmons]] and [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]], who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely.{{sfnm|1a1=Wendt|1y=2020|1p=2|2a1=Ashwood|2y=2018|2p=727}} Beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ.{{Sfn|Ashwood|2018|p=735}}

=== Gender, sexuality, and free love ===
{{Main|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex}}
As gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy, many anarchists address, analyse, and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy imposed by gender roles.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}}

[[File:AnarchaFeminism.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Collection of [[anarcha-feminist]] protests, symbols, and flags]]
Sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} Sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], who opposed age of consent laws, believing they would benefit predatory men.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=178}} A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]. In contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]], [[relationship anarchy]], and [[queer anarchism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women's sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} Those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists and other activists slept in beds together.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States; however, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, and pro-choice (utilising a contemporary term), and had a similar agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=166–167}}

During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[second wave of feminism]], radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalised groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} With the [[third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, yielding a [[post-structuralist]] critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} Some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}}

The interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider proper education, one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} Anarchist writers such as William Godwin (''[[Political Justice]]'') and Max Stirner (&quot;[[The False Principle of Our Education]]&quot;) attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222}}

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Escuela Moderna]] in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. Nonetheless, his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy, who published the essay ''Education and Culture'', also established a similar school with its founding principle being that &quot;for education to be effective it had to be free.&quot;{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517–518}} In a similar token, A. S. Neill founded what became the Summerhill School in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518–519}}

Anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child's right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions; however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation. Ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism, along with other critiques of government and nationalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1980|1pp=3–33|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=519–522}}

Late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ([[Paul Goodman]], [[Herbert Read]], and [[Colin Ward]]) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in [[consumerism]] as part of a consumer society.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=89–96}} Contemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality.{{sfn|Ward|1973|pp=39–48}}

While few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day, major tenets of anarchist schools, among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. Judith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists' schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools, the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England, and the Paideia School in Spain.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523–526}}

=== The arts ===
{{main|Anarchism and the arts}}
[[File:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|340px|''Les chataigniers a Osny'' (1888) by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro is a notable example of blending anarchism and the arts.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}]]
The connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=592}} In literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] and the [[neo-romanticism]] movement.{{sfn|Gifford|2019|p=577}} In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=493–494|2a1=Dunn|2y=2012|3a1=Evren|3a2=Kinna|3a3=Rouselle|3y=2013|p=138}} Anarchists such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Herbert Read]] stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=592–593}}

Other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=593}} In his book ''Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas'', Chris Robé claims that &quot;anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism.&quot;{{sfn|Robé|2017|p=44}} Throughout the 20th century, many prominent anarchists (Peter Kropotkin, [[Emma Goldman]], [[Gustav Landauer]] and [[Camillo Berneri]]) and publications such as ''[[Anarchy (magazine)|Anarchy]]'' wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.{{sfn|Miller|Dirlik|Rosemont|Augustyn|2019|p=1}}

Three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists. It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies, serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=593–596}} The 19th-century [[neo-impressionist]] movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=78}} In ''Les chataigniers a Osny'' by anarchist painter [[Camille Pissarro]], the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}

== Criticism ==
The most common critique of anarchism is the assertion that humans cannot [[Self-governance|self-govern]] and so a state is necessary for human survival. Philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] supported this critique, stating that &quot;[p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government.&quot;{{sfn|Krimerman|Perry|1966|p=494}} Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism.{{sfn|Ward|2004|p=78}}

Another criticism of anarchism is the belief that it is inherently unstable: that an anarchist society would inevitably evolve back into a state. [[Thomas Hobbes]] and other early social contract theorists argued that the state emerges in response to natural anarchy in order to protect the people's interests and keep order. Philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] argued that a &quot;[[night-watchman state]]&quot;, or minarchy, would emerge from anarchy through the process of an [[invisible hand]], in which people would exercise their liberty and buy protection from protection agencies, evolving into a minimal state. Anarchists reject these criticisms by arguing that humans in a [[state of nature]] would not just be in a state of war. [[Anarcho-primitivism|Anarcho-primitivists]] in particular argue that humans were better off in a state of nature in small tribes living close to the land, while anarchists in general argue that the negatives of state organization, such as hierarchies, monopolies and inequality, outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Fiala |first=Andrew |title=Anarchism |date=2021 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2021/entries/anarchism/ |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |access-date=2023-06-17 |edition=Winter 2021 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world, such as at protests, but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically. This line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory as a ruling theory that has no ruling theory. Anarchism also calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual, hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=&quot;4. Objections and Replies&quot;}}

Philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro-anarchist books such as A. John Simmons' ''Moral Principles and Political Obligations''.{{sfn|Klosko|1999|p=536}} Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious. Edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate.{{sfnm|1a1=Klosko|1y=1999|1p=536|2a1=Kristjánsson|2y=2000|2p=896}} In ''The Problem of Political Authority'', [[Michael Huemer]] defends philosophical anarchism,{{sfn|Dagger|2018|p=35}} claiming that &quot;political authority is a moral illusion.&quot;{{sfn|Rogers|2020|p=}}

One of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority.{{sfn|Ferguson|1886}} [[Joseph Raz]] states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=37}} Raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities' successful and mistaken instruction.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=38}} Anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable, nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment.{{sfn|Gans|1992|pp=34, 38}} Anarchist perception of human nature, rejection of the state, and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive, overly simplistic, and unrealistic, respectively.{{sfn|Brinn|2020|p=206}} Classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}}

[[Friedrich Engels]], considered to be one of the principal founders of Marxism, criticised anarchism's anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian.{{sfn|Tucker|1978}} Academic [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]] writes in his book ''Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism'' that &quot;anarchism cannot win&quot;, believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{sfn|Dodds|2011}} The Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to the Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining.{{sfn|Baár|Falina|Janowski|Kopeček|2016|p=488}}

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}; {{etymology|la|albedo|whiteness}}) is the fraction of [[sunlight]] that is [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] by a body. It is measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).

Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of [[Radiosity (radiometry)|radiosity]] ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; to the [[irradiance]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (flux per unit area) received by a surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Fundamentals of Rendering - Radiometry / Photometry|author1=Pharr|author2=Humphreys|website=Web.cse.ohio-state.edu|access-date=2 March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Reflectance and albedo, surface |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Atmosphere |editor=J.

A. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2003|pages=1914–1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location, and time (see [[position of the Sun]]). While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henderson-Sellers |first1=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M. F.|year=1983 |quote=Albedo observations of the Earth's surface for climate research |jstor=37357 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |volume=309 |issue=1508 |title=The Study of the Ocean and the Land Surface from Satellites |pages=285–294 |bibcode=1983RSPTA.309..285H |doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0042|s2cid=122094064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

[[Ice–albedo feedback]] is a [[positive feedback]] climate process where a change in the area of [[ice caps]], [[glaciers]], and [[sea ice]] alters the albedo and surface temperature of a planet. [[Ice]] is very reflective, therefore it reflects far more solar energy back to space than the other types of land area or open water. Ice–albedo feedback plays an important role in global [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Budyko |first=M.

Albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management. The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30–35% because of [[cloud cover]], but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/environmentalenc01cunn |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher=Thomson Gale |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7876-5486-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo – from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot; /&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites, and the CERES instrument on the [[Suomi NPP]] and [[Joint Polar Satellite System|JPSS]]. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot; /&gt;). These calculations are based on the [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about {{convert|15|C|F}}. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below {{convert|−40|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about {{convert|0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot; /&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called [[ocean planet]] – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost {{convert|27|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot; /&gt;

&lt;!--===Variability and recent/spatiotemporal changes===--&gt;
In 2021, scientists reported that Earth dimmed by ~0.5% over two decades (1998–2017) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques. This may have both been co-caused by [[climate change]] as well as a substantial increase in global warming. However, the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gray |first1=Jennifer |title=The Earth isn't as bright as it once was |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/04/weather/earth-dimming-climate/index.html |access-date=19 October 2021 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goode |first1=P.

===White-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo===
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:
* the [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and
* the [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]], &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo.
with &lt;math&gt;{1-D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = (1 - D) \bar\alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{\bar\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot; /&gt;

===Human activities===
[[File:(Almería) Greenhouses of Almería, Spain (cropped).jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of Almería, Spain]]
Human activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sagan |first1=Carl |last2=Toon |first2=Owen B. |last3=Pollack |first3=James B. |date=1979 |title=Anthropogenic Albedo Changes and the Earth's Climate |journal=Science |volume=206 |issue=4425 |pages=1363–1368 |bibcode=1979Sci...206.1363S |doi=10.1126/science.206.4425.1363 |issn=0036-8075 |jstor=1748990 |pmid=17739279 |s2cid=33810539}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Campra et al., [[Human impact on the environment|human impacts]] to &quot;the physical properties of the land surface can perturb the climate by altering the Earth’s radiative energy balance&quot; even on a small scale or when undetected by satellites.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Campra |first1=Pablo |last2=Garcia |first2=Monica |last3=Canton |first3=Yolanda |last4=Palacios-Orueta |first4=Alicia |date=2008 |title=Surface temperature cooling trends and negative radiative forcing due to land use change toward greenhouse farming in southeastern Spain |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=113 |issue=D18 |bibcode=2008JGRD..11318109C |doi=10.1029/2008JD009912 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tens of thousands of [[hectare]]s of greenhouses in [[Almería, Spain]] form a large expanse of whitened plastic roofs.

It has been found that [[urbanization]] generally decreases albedo (commonly being 0.01–0.02 lower than adjacent [[croplands]]), which contributes to [[global warming]]. Deliberately increasing albedo in urban areas can mitigate [[urban heat island]]. Ouyang et al. estimated that, on a global scale, &quot;an albedo increase of 0.1 in worldwide urban areas would result in a cooling effect that is equivalent to absorbing ~44 [[Gigatons|Gt]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ouyang |first1=Zutao |last2=Sciusco |first2=Pietro |last3=Jiao |first3=Tong |last4=Feron |first4=Sarah |last5=Li |first5=Cheyenne |last6=Li |first6=Fei |last7=John |first7=Ranjeet |last8=Peilei |first8=Fan |last9=Li |first9=Xia |last10=Williams |first10=Christopher A. |last11=Chen |first11=Guangzhao |last12=Wang |first12=Chenghao |last13=Chen |first13=Jiquan |date=July 2022 |title=Albedo changes caused by future urbanization contribute to global warming |journal=Nature Communications |volume=13 |issue=1 |page=3800 |bibcode=2022NatCo..13.3800O |doi=10.1038/s41467-022-31558-z |pmc=9249918 |pmid=35778380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intentionally enhancing the albedo of the Earth's surface, along with its daytime [[thermal emittance]], has been proposed as a [[Solar Radiation Management|solar radiation management]] strategy to mitigate [[Energy crisis|energy crises]] and global warming known as [[passive daytime radiative cooling]] (PDRC).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Tong |last2=Wu |first2=Yi |last3=Shi |first3=Lan |last4=Hu |first4=Xinhua |last5=Chen |first5=Min |last6=Wu |first6=Limin |date=2021 |title=A structural polymer for highly efficient all-day passive radiative cooling |journal=Nature Communications |volume=12 |issue=365 |page=365 |doi=10.1038/s41467-020-20646-7 |pmc=7809060 |pmid=33446648 |quote=Accordingly, designing and fabricating efficient PDRC with sufficiently high solar reflectance (𝜌¯solar) (λ ~ 0.3–2.5 μm) to minimize solar heat gain and simultaneously strong LWIR thermal emittance (ε¯LWIR) to maximize radiative heat loss is highly desirable.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==
[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The percentage of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] [[sunlight]] relative to various surface conditions]]

=== Illumination ===
Albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g. through melting of reflective ice). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winston&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolation effects===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] ([[solar irradiance]]); high albedo areas in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albedo Effect |url=https://www.npolar.no/en/fact/albedo/ |website=Norsk PolarInstitutt |publisher=Norwegian Polar Institue |access-date=23 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [[Ice–albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=8 May 2017|date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
{{Further|Ice–albedo feedback}}
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass, soil, or ocean, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Dorothy K. |author-link=Dorothy Hall (scientist)|title=Remote Sensing of Ice and Snow |date=1985 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-94-009-4842-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[Antarctica]] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [[positive feedback]]).

Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;All About Sea Ice.&quot; National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for [[global warming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland – Melt Zone&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175416/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 |date=3 March 2016 }} page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through [[remote sensing]] techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool!

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic devices]]. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10% for vertically (90°) mounted systems, but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | date = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | pages = 233–241 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 |bibcode = 2013SoEn...91..233A | url = https://www.academia.edu/3081684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectral albedo strongly affects the performance of [[bifacial solar cells]] where rear surface performance gains of over 20% have been observed for c-Si cells installed above healthy vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riedel-Lyngskær | first1 = Nicholas| last2 = Ribaconka | first2 = Ribaconka | last3 = Po | first3 = Mario | last4 = Thorseth | first4 = Anders | last5 = Thorsteinsson | first5 = Sune | last6 = Dam-Hansen | first6 = Carsten | last7 = Jakobsen | first7 = Michael L. | date = 2022| title = The effect of spectral albedo in bifacial photovoltaic performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 231| pages = 921–935 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2021.12.023 | bibcode = 2022SoEn..231..921R| s2cid = 245488941| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) provided effective albedo values for simulating the performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | author-link4 = J.

===Trees===
{{Update section|date=March 2023|reason=the references used are quite old; there must be more updated information available in the [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report]]}}
{{See also|Climate change#Land surface changes}}
Forests generally have a low albedo because the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]. For this reason, the greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of [[afforestation]] (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). In other words: The [[climate change mitigation]] effect of [[carbon sequestration]] by forests is partially counterbalanced in that [[reforestation]] can decrease the reflection of sunlight (albedo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Kaiguang |last2=Jackson |first2=Robert B |title=Biophysical forcings of land‐use changes from potential forestry activities in North America |journal=Ecological Monographs |date=2014 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=329–353 |doi=10.1890/12-1705.1 |url=https://jacksonlab.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj20871/files/media/file/em2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt; Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | date = 2004 | title = Direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | journal = Climate Dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6–7| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2004ClDy...22..597B | s2cid = 129640195 | url = https://www.academia.edu/25329256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonan | first1 = GB | date = 2008 | title = Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444–1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546|bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1444B  | s2cid = 45466312 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-to-high-latitude forests have a much lower albedo during snow seasons than flat ground, thus contributing to warming.

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt; Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ollinger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]].

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-01-31 |title=Arctic Reflection: Clouds Replace Snow and Ice as Solar Reflector |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/ArcticReflector/arctic_reflector4.php |access-date=2022-04-28 |website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=Nature |access-date=7 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2006|page=601|volume=418|issue=6898|date=8 August 2002|url-status=dead|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002Natur.418..601T|pmid=12167846|last1=Travis|first1=D.

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |access-date=19 August 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archive-date= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Spracklen et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In extremely polluted cities like [[Delhi]], aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an [[Urban heat island#Urban cold island|urban cool island]] effect during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Masson|first1=Valéry|last2=Lemonsu|first2=Aude|last3=Hidalgo|first3=Julia|last4=Voogt|first4=James|date=2020-10-17|title=Urban Climates and Climate Change|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|language=en|volume=45|issue=1|pages=411–444|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-012320-083623|doi-access=free|issn=1543-5938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean [[radiative forcing]] for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |access-date=19 August 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archive-date= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l.

== Astronomical albedo ==
[[File:Titan and Saturn - May 6 2012 - combined (35516187116).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is darker than [[Saturn]] even though they receive the same amount of sunlight. This is due to a difference in albedo (0.22 versus 0.499 in [[geometric albedo]]).]]In astronomy, the term '''albedo''' can be defined in several different ways, depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved.

===Optical or visual albedo===
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicardy&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but it is strongly directional and non-[[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian]], displaying also a strong [[opposition effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;medkeff&quot; /&gt; Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.

Two common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces. One of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the [[single-scattering albedo]]. It is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]), the size of the particle, and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

An important relationship between an object's astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is given by:&lt;ref name=&quot;bruton&quot;&gt;{{cite web

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometers, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute magnitude.

===Radar albedo===
In planetary [[radar astronomy]], a microwave (or radar) pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target (e.g. Moon, asteroid, etc.) and the echo from the target is measured. In most instances, the transmitted pulse is [[circular polarization|circularly polarized]] and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse (SC) and the opposite sense (OC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Planetary_Radar&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ostro |first1=S.

Those components of the received echo that return from first-surface reflections (as from a smooth or mirror-like surface) are dominated by the OC component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection. If the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith, there will be a significant SC component in the echo caused by multiple scattering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Asteroid_Radar&quot; /&gt;

For most objects in the solar system, the OC echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the (normalized) OC radar albedo (often shortened to radar albedo):&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Planetary_Radar&quot; /&gt;
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt; \hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} = \frac{{\sigma}_\text{OC}}{\pi r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where the denominator is the effective cross-sectional area of the target object with mean radius, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. A smooth metallic sphere would have &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}_\text{OC} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
